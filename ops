This will allow newslinkrss to generate podcasts or list of videos in a way the reader can handle automatically.\n\nMedia types should be inferred from URL suffix from the most common cases (.mp3, .mp4, .mkv ... .ogg is trickier) but there must be an option to the user set the correct media type.\n\nMedia types and content-lenghts can be detected by probing the candidate URL with a HEAD request.  I can expect badly configured sites failing on this kind of request, code should allow a HTTP GET request that is aborted once we get the required information. More command line switches required!\n\nSome post-processing may also be needed: filter regexes? Replacements?","files":null}]}
