It works pretty well for the general cases and for cases where the URL itself allows filtering items to be added to the feed, but fails for some complex cases and for cases when the URLs are too generic but there is enough information in the \"a\" elements to filter them.\n\nIdea: add new command line switches --links-from-xpath and --links-from-csss, as done with the other elements. They show accept several instances in the command line and can be mixed together. These switches must have the rules to select any element with an attribute \"href\" or, for XPath, a string. Most common case will be just selecting an \"a\" element.\n\nCandidate URLs can be selected with any combination of these command line switches. If none of them is given, fall back to the current selection strategy (using the same code to minimize chance unnintended changes to existing users).\n\nIf an \"a\" element is selected, extract URL from href and link text from the child elements; this will allow its use for the non-following mode. If a raw string is selected, it will be the URL (no link text will be available for non-following mode);\n\nPass all the captured candidate URLs through the usual -p and -i patterns to get the target URLs.","files":null}]}
