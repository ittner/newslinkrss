# About

newslinkrss generates RSS feeds from websites that do not provide their own.
This is done by loading a given URL and collecting links that matches a
pattern, given as a regular expression, to gather the relevant information,
optionally visiting them to get more details and even processing the target
pages with XPath and CSS Selectors if required. It basically works as a
purpose specific crawler or scraper.

The results are printed as a RSS feed to stdout or, optionally, to a file. The
simplest way to use it is just configure your **local** feed reader, like
[Liferea](https://lzone.de/liferea/) or [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), to
use a "command" source and pass the correct command line arguments to generate
a suitable feed -- this allows you to centralize the configuration in the
reader itself and let it handle update times, etc.

Run `newslinkrss --help` for the complete list of command line options.


# Intended audience (and a rant)

This script is mostly intended to technically versed people using some kind
of Unix operating system (e.g. Linux). I was planning to write a detailed
documentation but I just gave up. There is no much hope of making it friendly
to casual users when every use case requires complex command lines, abuse of
regular expressions, strftime strings, XPath, CSS Selectors, etc.

## The Rant

Everything would be just easier if websites simply provided clean and complete
RSS or Atom feeds, but these sites are becoming rarer every day. Most sites
just assume we want to follow them through social media (and that we *use*
social media!) while giving away privacy and submitting ourselves to tracking
and personal data collection in exchange for timelines algorithmically
optimized to improve "engagement" with advertisers.

I'm still resisting and wrote lots of feed scrapers/filters in the last 12 or
so years; newslinkrss is one that replaced several of these ad-hoc filters by
centralizing some very common pieces of code and it is polished enough to be
published.




# Installation


## Installing from PyPI

This is the simplest installation method and will deliver the latest **stable**
version of the program. To install in your `$HOME` directory, just type:

    pip3 install newslinkrss

This assumes pip3 is installed and configured (which usually happens by
default in Linux distributions intended for general use).



## Installing from the Git repository

This installation process is recommended for developers and people wanting
the newest version. For that, just clone the Git repository and install or
update the program with:

    pip3 install -U .

You may want to do this in a virtual environment so it won't interfere with
other user-level or system-wide components and make experimentation with
development versions easier. In this case, just do:

    python3 -m venv my-venv
    . my-venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U .


newslinkrss depends on a few libraries, this will ensure all them are also
installed correctly.



# Usage examples

newslinkrss is lacking a lot of documentation, but the following examples
can show a bit of what it can and can not do. A complete list of options
can be read by typing `newslinkrss --help`.


### Simplest case

The simplest use case is just load a website, select all links matching a
pattern and expose a feed using the text of that link as description and
setting the publish date to the date and time that the command was run. For
example, to generate a feed from site https://www.jaraguadosul.sc.gov.br/noticias.php ,
collecting all links with the substring `/news/` in the URL, use:

    newslinkrss -p '.+/news/.+' https://www.jaraguadosul.sc.gov.br/noticias.php

It won't generate a good feed (the limitation with the dates being the
biggest issue) but we will go back to this example later. It is already
more practical than checking this government website manually, however.



### Following pages

To improve the situation exposed in the previous example, we may want to
get information that it not is available from the URL or anchor text.
Option `--follow` (shortcut `-f`) will make newslinkrss load the candidate
target page and look for more data there. By default, it automatically
captures the title of the page as the title of the feed entry, keeps the
summary from anchor text, and loads author information and the page
publishing and update dates and times from the page metadata (**if** this
information is available in some common format, like
[Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) or Twitter cards.

Reuters [killed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23576022) its RSS feeds
in mid 2020, so let's take them as an example and use newslinkrss to bring
the feed back to life and right into our news readers. Our criteria will be:

- First we must find every link that appears as plain HTML on the front page:
  https://www.reuters.com/ There is an infinite scroll and more links are
  added periodically with JavaScript, but we can just ignore this and poll
  the page more frequently, giving enough chance to capture them;

- We want to be very selective with filtering so we only get the current news
  and do not waste time downloading things like section listings, utility
  pages, links for other domains, etc. By looking at the URLs of the news
  pages, we can notice that all of them follow a pattern similar to:
  https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-proposes-create-solidarity-fund-ukraines-basic-needs-2022-03-18/
  Notice they all are in domain "https://www.reuters.com/", have at least one
  section ("/world/europe/") that is followed by part of the title and the
  publish date. This format is really great, as it allows us to ignore
  anything that does not look like a news article on the spot. So, a good
  pattern will be `'https://www.reuters.com/.+/.+\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}.+'`;

- newslinkrss deduplicates URLs automatically, so we don't need to worry if we
  end up capturing the same link twice;

- Target pages have Open Graph meta tags, so by just following them we can
  get accurate publish dates and times with no extra effort. Better yet, as
  we know that **all** news pages that we want have them, we can also instruct
  newslinkrss to ignore any page without a valid date, preventing any non-news
  article, captured by accident, from appearing in our feed. This is done
  with option `--require-dates`;

- All page titles are something like "The actual headline | Reuters". This
  format is nice for a website but not so for feed items: the "| Reuters"
  part is not only redundant (the feed title already tells us about the
  source of the article) but also noise, as it makes scanning through the
  headlines harder. newslinkrss has an option `--title-regex` for exactly
  this use case of cleaning up redundant text from titles. It accepts a
  regular expression with a single capture group; if the expression matches,
  the text from the group will be used as the title, otherwise the original
  text will be used (so we don't loose titles if something changes at the
  source, for example). For this case, a good choice would be
  `--title-regex '(.+)\s+\|'` .

- When following pages we must be **very careful** as we do not want to
  abuse the website or get stuck downloading gigabytes of data. newslinkrss
  has several options to prevent these problems, all with sensible default
  values, but we should check if they work for every use case. At first we
  must limit number of links to be followed with option `--max-links` (the
  default value is 50, so it is OK for this so we can just omit the option
  for now), then we may use option `--max-page-length` to only load the
  first 512 kB of data from the every followed link, and stop processing a
  page after after a few seconds with option `--http-timeout` (the default
  value is 2 s, so we can omit this option for now too);

- Cookies will be remembered among these requests, but they will only be
  kept in memory and forgotten once the program finishes (there is an
  option `--no-cookies` if this behavior becomes a problem for a particular
  source).


So, our syntax for this will be:

    newslinkrss \
        --follow \
        -p 'https://www.reuters.com/.+/.+\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}.+' \
        --max-page-length 512 \
        --require-dates \
        --title-regex '(.+)\s+\|' \
        https://www.reuters.com/


### Generating complete feeds

Complete feeds are the ones which include the full text of the article with
it, instead of just a summary and a link. They are really nice as we can
read everything in the news aggregator itself. A good item body should be
mostly static and clean HTML (so no scripts, interactive content, aggressive
formatting, etc.) leaving everything else to the aggregator to handle.

Let's extend the previous example from Reuters website: as we are already
following and downloading the links, there is no much extra work to
generate the full feed from it. Option `--with-body` will copy the entire
contents of the "body" element from the page into the feed, just removing a
few obviously unwanted tags (scripts, forms, etc.).

Including the entire body works for every case, but for this site we can
filter a bit more and pick only actual text of the news article, ignoring
unwanted noise like menus, sidebars, links to other news, etc. Running a
quick "inspect element" in Firefox shows us that there is a single "article"
element in the pages and that it has the text we want. newslinkrss allows
using both XPath expressions and CSS Selectors to pick particular elements
from the DOM and, for this case, we choose XPath by using option
`--body-xpath '//article'` â€” sometimes CSS Selectors are easier and
cleaner, if it appears that you are struggling too much with a particular
XPath expression, try using a CSS Selector with `--body-csss` instead.

So, the updated syntax will be:

    newslinkrss \
        --follow \
        -p 'https://www.reuters.com/.+/.+\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}.+' \
        --max-page-length 512 \
        --with-body \
        --body-xpath '//article' \
        --require-dates \
        --title-regex '(.+)\s+\|' \
        https://www.reuters.com/

And now we have our feed!


### Gathering information from insufficient metadata

Some sites do not provide standard (not even quasi-standard) metadata that
newslinkrss can use automatically, so we must gather it from the pages
with site-specific approaches, following links and stitching information
from several elements together. Assume we want to generate a feed from
https://revistaquestaodeciencia.com.br/ , which provides no much facilities
for it. Looking into the site we find that:

- URLs for news articles have a date on them (in format `YYYY/MM/DD`), so it
  is possible to use this in the URL pattern (option `-p`) to limit which
  links the script will look for. Some are prefixed by a section stub and all
  are followed by a string generated from the title, so the regex must accept
  the date anywhere in it. Anything could be a filter here, but as all
  articles have a date on it we don't need to look anywhere else;

- There is no standard, not even de-facto standard, representation for the
  date an article was published, so the alternative is taking it from the URL
  too. This is done with options `--date-from-url` (which requires regular
  expression with a group capturing the substring that contains the date)
  `--url-date-fmt` (which defines the format of the date);

- Inconsistencies in the link formats prevent us from getting all articles
  titles from the links in the front page, so the alternative is to
  `--follow` every candidate link, downloading the target page and looking
  for  the title there.

- As we are already following, there is no much extra effort to also
  generate a complete feed. The full text of the article is in an "article"
  element, so we can use `--body-xpath "//article"` here too.

The resulting command line is:

    newslinkrss -p '.+/\d{4}/\d{2}/\d{2}/.+' \
        --date-from-url '.*/(\d{4}/\d{2}/\d{2})/.*' \
        --url-date-fmt '%Y/%m/%d' \
        --follow \
        --with-body \
        --body-xpath "//article" \
        --max-links 50 \
        --max-page-length 512 \
        --http-timeout 4 \
        'https://revistaquestaodeciencia.com.br/'

To make understanding easier, this example uses the long, verbose, form of
some options even when abbreviations are available. For the same reason, some
of the options are set to the default values and are not strictly required
but they are listed anyway. See `newslinkrss --help` for details.


### Using complex XPath expressions

Sometimes we need to fight really hard to get the date that a particular item
was last updated. Taking GitHub issues as an example: while GH provides Atom
feeds for releases and commits (but always to specific branches), there is
no equivalent for issues and pull requests. Of course, there is an API for
that but it requires authentication with a GitHub account, enables tracking,
and requires writing a specific bridge to get the data as a feed. This makes
the scraping approach easier even with the very convoluted example that
follows.

The URLs for issues and PRs are pretty usable, we can already use them to
limit how many issues will be shown, their status, filter by date, etc. Just
look at the one used in the example.

However, we need to get the date of the last comment on the issue and set it
as the publishing date of the item, otherwise the reader won't show us that
it was updated. A solution is to follow every issue page while using a XPath
expression to find the last occurrence of a "relative-time" tag that GitHub
uses to mark the timestamp of a comment and parse the absolute date from
attribute "datetime". This is done with options `--date-from-xpath` and
`--xpath-date-fmt`.

The resulting command line is the following:

    newslinkrss \
        --follow \
        --with-body \
        --http-timeout 5 \
        --max-links 30 \
        --max-page-length 1024 \
        -p '^https://github.com/.+/issues/\d+$' \
        --date-from-xpath '(//h3/a/relative-time)[last()]/@datetime' \
        --xpath-date-fmt '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' \
        'https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc'

Debugging XPath expressions is not a very easy task, the simplest way is just
open the target page in Firefox, launch web developer tools and use the $x()
helper function to get what the expression will return, for example:
`$x('(//h3/a/relative-time)[last()]/@datetime')`.



### The first example, revisited

Now that we have a few extra tricks on our sleeves we can check back that
very first example and fix some of its limitations:

- First, we need the correct publish dates; they are neither in the URL nor
  in the anchor text, so we need to `--follow` the pages and get them from
  there. The pages also have no metadata for that, but there is a publish
  date intended for human readers there in this slice of HTML:
  `<small class="text-muted"><b>23/12/2022</b> - some random text</small>`
  The important part if that we can use a XPath expression to select that
  date and then parse it; a good (not optimal! It does not follow CSS rules)
  would be `--date-from-xpath '//small[@class="text-muted"]/b/text()'` and
  it will capture the "23/12/2022" from the text node of the inner "b"
  element, no need to filter it through `--xpath-date-regex` to remove
  unwanted text, so we can then parse it with `--xpath-date-fmt '%d/%m/%Y'`;

- Let's be extra careful with the URL patterns, so we don't follow a
  random link going to another domain;

- As we are already following the pages, let's also generate a full feed.
  The relevant part of the articles are inside a "div" element with
  attribute "id" set to "area_impressao" (that's Portuguese for
  "printing_area" and one may imagine it is being used to format the page
  for printing, however there is neither an alternate style sheet nor a
  @media selector for it ... anyway, at least it helps us to select the
  correct text). We can isolate this element with a XPath expression
  `'//div[@id="area_impressao"]'` but this is slightly more complex than
  the equivalent CSS Selector `div#area_impressao` and, as we already used
  XPath in several examples, let's use a CSSS this time;

- That site can be a bit slow sometimes, so let's be extra tolerant and
  increase the HTTP timeout to 10 s;

And then we have our fixed command line:

    newslinkrss \
        -p 'https://www.jaraguadosul.sc.gov.br/news/.+' \
        --http-timeout 10 \
        --follow \
        --with-body \
        --body-csss 'div#area_impressao' \
        --date-from-xpath '//small[@class="text-muted"]/b/text()' \
        --xpath-date-fmt '%d/%m/%Y' \
        https://www.jaraguadosul.sc.gov.br/noticias.php

... not perfect, but it gives us a very practical and usable feed!



## More useful notes


### Capturing publish dates

The date when a particular item was published is one of the most useful pieces
of information from a feed, so newslinkrss has several ways of getting it
from source pages, with availability depending on the way it is used (i.e.
with or without `--follow`) and the information avaialble in the HTML.
Related options are the following:


- If `--follow` is used, dates will be read automatically from standard
  metadata (Open Graph, etc.) if they exists in the target page, no further
  options are necessary;

- Options `--date-from-text` and `--text-date-fmt` allow reading the date from
  the anchor text (i.e., the text inside tag `<a>`) associated to a particular
  entry in the index page; no `--follow` is necessary. The first option must
  provide a regular expression with a single capture group for the date
  (which allows removing non-date parts of the string) and the second option
  should give the date format. If the format is not given, the code will try
  some common date formats;

- Options `--date-from-url` and `--url-date-fmt` allow reading the date from
  the item link; this is specially interesting for sites that have URLs in
  format "https://example.org/posts/2020/09/22/happy-hobbit-day/" but provide
  no better source for a publish date. Again, no `--follow` is necessary. The
  first option must provide a regular expression with a single capture group
  with the date and the second option should give the date format. If the
  format is not given, code will try some common date formats;

- Options `--date-from-xpath`, `--xpath-date-regex`, and `--xpath-date-fmt`
  allow reading dates from any element in the target page which can be found
  with a XPath expression. Naturally, the target page which must be downloaded
  with `--follow`; The XPath expression must return a string (from the inner
  text or the attributes of an element), the second must optionally provide a
  regular expression with a single capture group with the date, and the third
  should give the date format. If no regex is given, all the string will be
  used and if no date format is given, the code will try some common date
  formats;

- Options `--date-from-csss`, `--csss-date-regex`, and `--csss-date-fmt` work
  in a similar way as the previous ones, but using CSS Selectors instead.
  They are not as powerful or flexible as XPath, but simpler, cleaner, and
  more suitable for HTML.


These options are tried in this order with the first valid date being picked,
so no date will be read from a CSS Selector if it was already sucessfuly read
from the page metadata.


### Ignoring URLs

The link pattern (-p) has a counterpart `--ignore-pattern` (shortcut `-i`)
which also accepts a regular expression and makes `newslinkrss` ignore any
matching URL. Depending on the amount of information that the website puts on
the URLs, this can be used for excluding native advertisement, uninteresting
sections, or other unwanted content from the feed, without support from the
feed reader and without counting to the total URL limit (`-n`). While it is
possible to add this ignore rule to the link pattern itself, using `-i`
prevents that regular expression from becoming excessively complex and makes
debugging easier.



### Excluding body elements

When generating a complete feed we may sometimes end up including some
unwanted elements from the source page into the item body, usually ads,
"related news" boxes, section headers, random images, distracting formatting,
unrelated links, etc. Some, but not all, of these noise sources can be
removed by carefully crafting XPath expressions or CSS selectors, but for the
cases where this is not possible, demand too much effort, or result in a
fragile solution, we can just remove the unwanted elements explicitly.

newslinkrss has tree command line options for this:

- Option `--body-remove-tag` (shortcut `-R`) will remove all occurrences of
  the given tag from the feed body and move their child elements to their
  parents. This can be used to remove formatting while preserving the inner
  text (e.g. `-R strong`) or to remove images from the body (with `-R  img`,
  as "img" elements have no children);

- Option `--body-remove-xpath` (shortcut `-X`) will remove the elements
  given by a XPath expression **and** their children. This is a good way
  to remove banners, divs, etc. from the generated feed;

- Option `--body-remove-csss` (shortcut `-C`) will remove the elements given
  by a CSS Selector **and** their children. This is another way to remove
  banners, divs, etc. from the generated and more practical when selecting
  element by their CSS classes.

All three options can be repeated in the command line how many times as
necessary to express all required rules.



### Testing links

newslinkrss has an option `--test` that will skip the feed generation step
and just print the links and titles that were captured for a particular set
of options to stdout. That's a simple way to check if a pattern is working
as intended.


### Logging

Things **will** go wrong when experimenting with ugly regexes and confusing
XPath expressions or when fighting unexpected changes in some website's DOM.
Simplest way to see how newslinkrss is reacting internally is to increase
output verbosity with option `--log`; default value is "warning", but "info"
and "debug" will give more information like which element a XPath expression
found, if a regex matched or how some date was interpreted.

This information is always printed to stderr so it will not affect the feed
output written to stdout; when debugging in the terminal, remember to
redirect the output to a file with the shell or command line option `-o`.


### Error reporting

By default, newslinkrss writes exceptions and error messages to the feed
output itself. This is a very practical way to report errors to the user, as
this program is intended to work mostly on the background of the actual
user-facing application. It is possible to disable this behavior with option
`--no-exception-feed` (shortcut `-E`).

Notice that the program always return a non-zero status code on failures. Some
news readers (e.g. Liferea) won't process the output in these cases and discard
the feed entries with the error reports. You may need to override the status
code with something like `newslinkrss YOUR_OPTIONS; exit 0`.


### Writing output to a file

Option `-o` allows writing the output to an file; it is no much different
than redirecting stdout, but will ensure that only valid XML with the right
encoding is written.

Writing output to files and error reporting on the feed itself allows for
some unusual but interesting use patterns: for example, it is trivial for a
company, group, or development team to have an internal "feed server", where
feeds are centrally downloaded by a cron job, saved to a web server public
directory and then transparently provided to the end users. A setup with
Alpine and nginx running in a LXD container is surprisingly small.




## Caveats

Be very careful with escape characters! In the shell, it is recommended to
use single quotes for regexes, so "\\" is not escaped. This becomes more
confusing if your feed reader also use escape sequences but with different
or conflicting rules (e.g. Newsboat uses "\\" as escapes but does not follow
the same rules used by bash). When in doubt, run the command in the shell or
use a wrapper script to test for any unusual behavior introduced by the
program.

Some feed readers run commands in a synchronous (blocking) mode and their
interface will get stuck until the command terminates. Liferea had this
behavior [until version 1.13.7](https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea/commit/b03af3b0f6a4e42b17dfa49782faa6c044055738),
for example. A typical workaround is to create a script with all calls to
newslinkrss that saves the generated feeds to files (see option `-o`),
schedule this script to run from cron and configure Liferea to load the
feed from the files. This solves the frozen interface problem, but requires
configuring feeds in two different places.



# Bugs

Yes :-)



# Contributing

For this project I started an experiment: I'm using [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/)
as the primary repository for code and other tools, leaving the usual Github
and Gitlab as non-advertised mirrors. Sourcehut does everything by the
old-school way and most features just work without an user account. Check the
[project page](https://sr.ht/~ittner/newslinkrss/) there to see how it works.

If this sounds too strange, just clone the repository with an
`git clone https://git.sr.ht/~ittner/newslinkrss`, publish your fork somewhere
and send an email with the branches to be merged to `~ittner/newslinkrss@lists.sr.ht`
(that's correct: tildes and slashes are valid characters for email addresses).

If you change the code, please run in through pyflakes for static analysis and
[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to ensure a consistent formatting.
