# About

newslinkrss generates RSS feeds from generic sites that do not provide
their own. This is done by loading a given URL and collecting all links
that matches a pattern (given as a regular expression) to gather relevant
information

The results are output as a RSS feed to stdout or, optionally, a file.

Run `./newslinkrss --help` for the complete command line details.
